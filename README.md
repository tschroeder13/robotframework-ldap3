# LDAP3 Library for Robot Framework

The LDAP Library for [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org) provides keywords to interact with directory servers via LDAP protocol.
Therefore the platform independent python library [ldap3](https://ldap3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used, which provides extended namespaces for interacting with Microsoft and Novell based directories beside the default RFC 4511 namespace.
